    <h1>PigPal — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: <strong>September 6, 2025</strong></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      PigPal (the "App") is developed and provided by SuperApps ("we", "us", "our"). PigPal helps farmers
      manage piggery tasks such as breeding, feeding, vaccinations, inventory and transactions.
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can control it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This policy applies to personal data collected through the PigPal mobile application and any
      related services (for example, support or web pages we operate). It does not apply to information
      collected offline or by third parties that we do not control.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device & technical data:</strong> device model, operating system version, app version, language and basic diagnostics for crash reports and troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>App data you enter:</strong> farm records, animal tags, breeding logs, vaccination and deworming records, inventory and transaction entries — essentially the farm data you store in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> anonymous or pseudonymized analytics events (which features are used, timestamps) to help us improve the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Support data:</strong> messages you send to support (email content, screenshots if provided) when you contact us.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How we use your data</h2>
    <p>We use the data we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain the app’s core functionality (store and retrieve farm records).</li>
      <li>Send optional reminders or notifications (if you enable them) for vaccinations, heats, etc.</li>
      <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues (crash reports and logs).</li>
      <li>Conduct analytics to improve features, performance and user experience.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests you send to us.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legal basis for processing (where applicable)</h2>
    <p>
      Where required under applicable law (for example, in the EU), our legal basis for processing your
      personal data is: performance of a contract (to provide app features), your consent (for optional analytics
      or marketing), or our legitimate interests (to operate and improve the app) as permitted by law.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data in these limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> third parties who provide analytics, crash reporting, hosting, or email delivery (e.g., Firebase, Sentry, or similar). These providers process data on our behalf under contract.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> if required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, subject to confidentiality protections.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-party services and links</h2>
    <p>
      PigPal may use third-party services (analytics, crash reporting, or cloud services). These providers
      have their own privacy policies. Examples may include Google Analytics / Firebase and Crashlytics, but we
      will list the specific providers in the app store privacy details and on this page when used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app may also contain links to external websites (for documentation or support). We are not
      responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Where and how we store data</h2>
    <p>
      Most app data you enter is stored locally on your device by default (e.g., in an on-device database).
      If you enable any cloud-sync feature (not required), data may be stored on cloud servers — we will
      explicitly request consent before enabling remote sync.
    </p>
    <p>
      We retain support and diagnostic logs for as long as needed to troubleshoot and improve the app,
      and for any period required by law.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect your data.
      However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure — if you have sensitive personal data,
      consider whether to store it in the app.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Analytics, crash reporting & opt-out</h2>
    <p>
      We may collect anonymous analytics and crash reports to understand app performance and usage.
      You may opt out of analytics in the app’s Privacy settings (if provided). Opting out will not affect
      core app functionality.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      PigPal is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
      If you believe a child under 13 has provided us personal data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal data, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of your data.</li>
      <li>Request a copy of your data in a commonly used format.</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below. We may ask you to verify your identity.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data export and deletion</h2>
    <p>
      If you would like a copy of your data or want your data removed, contact us at
      <a href="mailto:superappsindia@gmail.com">superappsindia@gmail.com</a>. We will respond to legitimate requests within a reasonable timeframe.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy at the same URL
      and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. For material changes, we will provide a more
      prominent notice where required by law.
    </p>
  </section>
