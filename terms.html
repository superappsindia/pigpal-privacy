      It is for informational and record-keeping purposes only and does <em>not</em> replace veterinary, medical,
      financial, accounting, or legal advice.
    </p>

      You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use PigPal.

      <li>Your cloud data is encrypted <strong>in transit</strong> and <strong>at rest</strong>.</li>
      <li>You can disable cloud sync anytime in settings. Disabling sync stops new uploads but does not automatically delete existing backups.</li>

      <li>SuperApps is not liable for data loss due to device damage, deletion, account issues, or user error.</li>

      <li>Reminders are informational only and should not replace professional advice.</li>
