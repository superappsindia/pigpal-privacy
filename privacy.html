    <h1>PigPal — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: <strong>October 10, 2025</strong></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      PigPal (the "App") is developed and provided by SuperApps ("we", "us", "our"). PigPal helps farmers
      manage piggery tasks such as breeding, feeding, vaccinations, inventory and transactions.
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we store it
      (including cloud storage), and how you can control it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This policy applies to personal and farm-related data collected through the PigPal mobile and web applications,
      associated backend services (including Firebase, Firestore, and cloud synchronization), and any
      related support channels. It does not apply to information collected offline or by unaffiliated third parties.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device & technical data:</strong> device model, operating system version, app version, language, and basic diagnostics for crash reports and troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>App data you enter:</strong> farm records, animal tags, breeding logs, vaccination and deworming records, feed and inventory data, financial transactions, and other farm management information you choose to store in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> anonymous or pseudonymized analytics events (feature usage, timestamps) to help us improve the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud sync data:</strong> when you enable cloud synchronization or backups, copies of your farm records are securely stored on cloud servers (for example, Google Firebase Firestore or Cloud Storage) under your account identifier.</li>
      <li><strong>Support data:</strong> messages, attachments, or screenshots you send to us when contacting support.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How we use your data</h2>
    <p>We use the data we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain app functionality, both offline and through secure cloud synchronization.</li>
      <li>Send optional reminders or server-based notifications (if you enable them) for vaccinations, breeding, and feeding schedules.</li>
      <li>Backup and restore your data safely across devices via encrypted cloud sync (if you opt in).</li>
      <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues, including crash reporting and performance optimization.</li>
      <li>Conduct analytics to improve features and user experience.</li>
      <li>Respond to your support and feedback requests.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Cloud storage and synchronization</h2>
    <p>
      PigPal allows you to optionally sync your farm data to our secure cloud infrastructure (powered by Google Firebase).
      When enabled, your records are encrypted in transit and stored in a secure cloud database under your authenticated user ID.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cloud sync enables data backup, restoration on multiple devices, and server-based notifications (such as reminders before due tasks).
      You can disable sync at any time from within the app’s settings. Disabling sync will stop further uploads but will not automatically delete existing cloud copies.
      You may request full deletion of your cloud data via email.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> All cloud data is stored in Firebase data centers operated by Google Cloud,
      which may be located in different regions depending on your country of use. Data transfers comply with
      applicable data protection regulations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited information only in these cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> trusted third parties (e.g., Google Firebase, Crashlytics, or analytics partners)
        who help us operate the app, store data, or send notifications. They process data under strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> when required by law or to protect our rights, property, or users’ safety.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, subject to data protection safeguards.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Locally stored data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
      Cloud-stored data (if enabled) is retained as long as your account is active or until you request deletion.
      Support and diagnostic logs are kept only as long as needed for troubleshooting or as required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may request deletion of your cloud data and associated account by contacting us at
      <a href="mailto:superappsindia@gmail.com">superappsindia@gmail.com</a>.
      Deletion requests will be processed within a reasonable timeframe and confirmed once complete.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We apply industry-standard security practices, including encrypted transmission (HTTPS), secure authentication (Firebase Auth),
      and limited data access on a need-to-know basis. However, no electronic storage is 100% secure — we advise users
      to avoid storing sensitive personal information (like financial credentials) in the app.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Analytics, crash reporting & opt-out</h2>
    <p>
      PigPal uses analytics and crash reporting (for example, Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics)
      to improve stability and performance. These tools collect anonymous data only.
      You may opt out of analytics collection through the in-app privacy settings without affecting core features.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      PigPal is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from them.
      If such information is discovered, it will be deleted promptly upon notification.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your region, you may have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access and review your personal or farm-related data stored by PigPal.</li>
      <li>Request correction, export, or deletion of your data.</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent for analytics or cloud synchronization at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise your rights, please contact us at the address below. Verification may be required before action.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be posted at this URL, with a revised “Last updated” date.
      Significant changes will be communicated within the app or by email when appropriate.
    </p>
  </section>
